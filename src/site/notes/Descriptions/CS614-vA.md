> [!NOTE]- About the Course
> This course will be an exploration of approximation algorithms, focusing on techniques designed to find near-optimal solutions to computationally hard problems. Students will learn how to analyze the performance of these algorithms and apply them to various practical problems in computer science and operations research. This is one kind of _coping strategy_ for problems that are theoretically hard. See here for an overview of other algorithmic paradigms in this context.
> 
> We will introduce the approximation paradigm with a motivating example (Load Balancing). We will then focus on a numbe rof LP-based methods for various problems, including Vertex Cover, Set Cover, Facility Location, Steiner Forest, Multiway Cut, Bin Packing, and so on. After getting familiar with encoding problems as linear programs, we will learn about deterministic and randomized rounding methods for deriving approximate solutions efficiently. We will also learn about primal-dual based approximation algorithms. Finally, we will introduce approximation schemes (in the context of Knapsack) and SDP-based methods (for maximum cut).
