This webpage is work-in-progress. My aim here is to collect information around the courses I teach. Using the navigation on the left, you can can find:

1. pages that document information pertinent to a specific offering
2. lecture notes on a limited set of topics
3. a collection of exercises grouped according to (a very rough estimate of) difficulty and organized by theme-oriented tags.
