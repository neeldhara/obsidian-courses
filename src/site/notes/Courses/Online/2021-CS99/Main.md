> [!NOTE]- About the Course
> This is a course on algorithm design with a focus on issues of modeling and implementation. Each lecture will be focused entirely on one or two problems that reveal the use of a specific algorithmic technique. The techniques themselves are chosen to be in line with those covered in existing NPTEL courses on data structures and algorithms, so that students who complete those courses can find in this course a natural follow up. This course is intended for anyone who wants to deepen their appreciation for algorithmic techniques that they have learned in a foundational course and/or would like to take a first step towards preparing for coding competitions such as the ICPC.

> [!TLDR]- Target Audience
> This course is aimed at undergraduates in their second year onwards, as a follow-up to a first introduction to data structures and algorithms.

> [!Tip]- Pre-requisites
> The course assumes familiarity with elementary data structures and algorithms. While some algorithms will be reviewed, the course will be harder than intended for a learner pursuing it without any prior exposure to topics like searching, sorting, graph algorithms, and asymptotics. 
> 
> Working familiarity with a programming language will be a significant advantage. The specific choice of language is not particularly crucial: the only thing to keep in mind is that if you choose a relatively exotic option, it may be harder to get help from your peers and/or the TAs. 
> 
> While examples in the lectures are explained with C++, variations of the code in C, Python and Java are available thanks to contributions from volunteers.

> [!info]- Grading Policy
> The grading policy, applicable to all students pursuing this course for a formal certification, is as per general NPTEL norms, which is typically the following:
> 
> **A learner will pass and be certified only if Average assignment score (out of 100) >= 40 AND Final exam score ( out of 100) >= 40**. That is, to clear the exam you have to score a minimum of 10 out of 25% in the assignment and 30 out of 75% in the final proctored exam.

> [!calendar]- Registration & Evaluation Logistics
> 
> 1. Registration is through the NPTEL platform. The enrolment deadline is _09-Aug-2021_.
> 2. Weekly assignments will be issued through the NPTEL portal, and are typically due within ~10 days of release.
> 3. There is one final exam to be held on 24 Oct 2021, which will be held in person in a proctored setting. More details will be sent through NPTEL over email to all registered candidates.
