> [!NOTE]- About the Course
> This is a first course on techniques in parameterized algorithms, a paradigm of algorithm design that analyzes running time in finer detail than classical complexity theory: instead of expressing the running time as a function of the input size only, dependence on one or more parameters of the input instance is taken into account. 
> 
> This is a fast-evolving field and a fundamental approach to coping with NP-hardness, alongside approximation and randomized algorithms. The course will be a natural follow-up to a first course in algorithms and data structures for theoretically-inclined students and those who are curious about approaches to dealing with the theoretical limitations that emerge from the theory of NP-completeness.

> [!TLDR]- Target Audience
> Undergraduate students who have already done a basic data structures/algorithms course.

> [!Tip]- Pre-requisites
> A first course in (undergraduate level) data structures and algorithms, and discrete mathematics.

> [!reference]- References

> [!info]- Grading Policy
> The grading policy, applicable to all students pursuing this course for a formal certification, is as per general NPTEL norms, which is typically the following:
> 
> **A learner will pass and be certified only if Average assignment score (out of 100) >= 40 AND Final exam score ( out of 100) >= 40**. That is, to clear the exam you have to score a minimum of 10 out of 25% in the assignment and 30 out of 75% in the final proctored exam.

> [!calendar]- Registration & Evaluation Logistics
> 
> 1. Registration is through the NPTEL platform. The enrolment deadline is _07-Aug-2023_.
> 2. Weekly assignments will be issued through the NPTEL portal, and are typically due within ~10 days of release.
> 3. There is one final exam to be held on 28 Oct 2024, which will be held in person in a proctored setting. More details will be sent through NPTEL over email to all registered candidates.
