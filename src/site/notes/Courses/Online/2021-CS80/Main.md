> [!NOTE]- About the Course
>The course will be an introduction to Discrete Mathematics which comprises of the essentials for a computer science student to go ahead and study any other topics in the subject. The emphasis will be on problem solving as well as proofs. We will be providing motivational illustrations and applications through out the course. The course doesn't assume any pre-requisites except for high school level arithmetic and algebra.

> [!TLDR]- Target Audience
> This course is aimed at undergraduates in their first or second year, as a first introduction to discrete mathematics. 

> [!Tip]- Pre-requisites
> The course is largely self-contained.

> [!info]- Grading Policy
> The grading policy, applicable to all students pursuing this course for a formal certification, is as per general NPTEL norms, which is typically the following:
> 
> **A learner will pass and be certified only if Average assignment score (out of 100) >= 40 AND Final exam score ( out of 100) >= 40**. That is, to clear the exam you have to score a minimum of 10 out of 25% in the assignment and 30 out of 75% in the final proctored exam.
