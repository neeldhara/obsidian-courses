> [!NOTE]- About the Course
> In this course, we will introduce many little-known theorems of advanced mathematics. We will go on a roller coaster ride from delightful self-working magic tricks to serious math, then back again to magic. The tricks don’t require any sleight of hand or trickery.
> 
> A similar course is taught at Stanford University by a former professional magician named Persi Diaconis. At school, Diaconis supported himself by playing poker on ships between New York and South America. Martin Gardner, a writer at Scientific American, once saw him and recommended to a professor for Ph.D. at Harvard University.
> 
> In two days, we would learn about Hummer shuffles, Royal Hummer, de Bruijn Sequences, Universal Cycles, Mandelbrot Set, Neat Shuffles and many more card tricks. You would have about 10 cool card tricks up your sleeve and you would be comfortable exploring many more as you would know the terminology of math card tricks by the end of the course.
