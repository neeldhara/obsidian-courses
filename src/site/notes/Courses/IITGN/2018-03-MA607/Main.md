> [!NOTE]- About the Course
> Data structures give us principled ways to stow away information. It’s important to do this nicely: and what that means is to work backwards from what you want to _do_ with your information, so that your storage style is optimized for the specific way in which you need to work with your data.
>
> For example, the notes you might be taking in this class is a kind of information.
> 
> If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!
>
> However, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don’t have to be neat, and it’s enough for them to be useful.
>
> On the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.
>
> Throughout this course, we will understand such trade-offs in several scenarios.
> 
> > [!NOTE]+ Topics
> > sequential data (arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists and variants) • dequeues, stacks, queues • graph representations • graph traversals (BFS/DFS) and applications (connected components, bipartiteness, topological sort) • searching and sorting • heaps • BSTs • (2,3)-trees

> [!TLDR]- Target Audience
> This course is aimed at undergraduates in their first or second year, as a first introduction to data structures and algorithms.

> [!Tip]- Pre-requisites
> The course is largely self-contained. Working familiarity with a programming language will be useful for the labs, where solutions are expected to be written out in C.
