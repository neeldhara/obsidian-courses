> [!reference] Based on [[Materials/DSA/De Bruijn Sequences\|this card trick]].

> [!question]- Count Vertices
> Consider a graph G whose vertex set has one vertex for every bit string of length 4. How many vertices does this graph have? Enter a number (not a word).

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> 16

> [!question]- Count Edges
> Consider two vertices in this graph, u and v. There is an edge from u to v if the 3-bit suffix (i.e, the last three bits) of u matches with the 3-bit prefix of v (i.e, the first three bits). **Note that this graph need not be simple; in particular, some vertices may have self-loops.**

> What is the outdegree of every vertex?

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> 2

> [!question]- Euler Tour
> Does this graph have a closed Euler tour?
