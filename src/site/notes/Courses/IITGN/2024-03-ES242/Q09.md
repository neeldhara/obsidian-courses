> [!question]- How Disconnected Does it Get? (Undirected)
> The deletion of an edge from an undirected connected graph can lead to the formation of at most X connected components, where X is:
> 
> - [ ] 1
> - [ ] 2
> - [ ] 3
> - [ ] None of the above

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Suppose there is an edge $e$ such that $G \setminus e$ has more than two connected components. $e$ has endpoints in at most two of these components, so $G$ could not have been connected to begin with, a contradiction. Therefore, $X = 2$.

> [!question]- How Disconnected Does it Get? (Directed)
> The deletion of an edge from an directed connected graph can lead to the formation of at most X _strongly_ connected components, where X is:
> 
> - [ ] 1
> - [ ] 2
> - [ ] 3
> - [ ] None of the above

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Suppose $G$ is a directed cycle on $n$ vertices, and we remove one edge: we get $n-1$ strongly connected components. So the answer here is `none of the above`.

> [!question]- Grid Graphs
> The 10 X 10 grid graph is:
> 
> - [ ] bipartite (i.e, can be properly colored with two colors)
> - [ ] tripartite (i.e, can be properly colored with at most three colors but not two)
> - [ ] 4-colorable (i.e, can be properly colored with at most four colors but not three)
> - [ ] acyclic

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> The grid has no odd cycles and is hence 2-colorable.
