> [!question]- 15 Puzzle Array Implementation
> Suppose you are implementing the 15 puzzle game:
> 
> This is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1â€“15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. In one move, the user can choose a tile that is vertically or horizontally _adjacent_ to the empty tile. The outcome of this move is that the empty tile is replaced by the tile that was chosen, and the location of the chosen tile is the new empty tile. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles and place them in increasing numerical order.
> 
> An example configuration is shown in the image below:
> ![15 Puzzle Example](/img/user/Exercises/Short-Answer/figures/0008.png)
> 
> You decide to record the game state as a list of length 16, with elements between 0-15 (0 denotes the empty cell), using the following convention:
> 
> 1. the first four elements contain the numbers in the first row of the board,
> 
> 2. the fifth-eighth elements contain the numbers in the second row of the board,
> 
> 3. the ninth-twelfth elements contain the numbers in the third row of the board, and
> 
> 4. the thirteenth-sixteenth element contain the numbers in the fourth row of the board.
> 
> Suppose you generalise this to a game involving a N X N board, using a list of size N^2, stored as an array. The user indicates how they want to move at every step. Assume you can directly access and update any element in your list, and accesses and updates are constant time (i.e, independent of N).
> 
> Suppose the user wants to make a specific move, which is given by the row and column number of the chosen tile. How much time do you need to update the configuration for this single move?
> 
> - [ ] proportional to N> - [ ] proportional to N
> - [ ] constant

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Note that only two locations need to be updated: the chosen tile and the empty tile. We can derive the location of the empty tile by checking the four locations adjacent to the chosen tile. Since the number of adjacent tiles is constant (4), the time complexity is constant.

> - [ ] proportional to N> - [ ] proportional to N

> [!question]- 2048 Game: Array Implementation
> Suppose you are implementing the [2048 game](https://play2048.co/):
> 
> 2048 is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.
> 
> Feel free to play the game at the link above to get a feel for it.
> 
> Suppose you are implementing a version of 2048 on a N X N board, using a list of size N^2. As in the previous question, the list carries information about the state of the board: the first N elements correspond to the numbers in the first row, and so on. The user indicates in which direction they want to move at every step. Assume you can directly access and update any element in your list.

> - [ ] constant

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> 
> There could be, in principle, moves that require a update of almost all the cells in the board. It is easy to check that the move can in fact be implemented in $O(N^2)$ time with a couple of passes over every row or column, once to compute the collisions and track the new values obtained from the merges, and another pass to write out the new state.
