> [!NOTE]- About the Course
> Data structures give us principled ways to stow away information. It’s important to do this nicely: and what that means is to work backwards from what you want to _do_ with your information, so that your storage style is optimized for the specific way in which you need to work with your data.
>
> For example, the notes you might be taking in this class is a kind of information.
> 
> If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!
>
> However, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don’t have to be neat, and it’s enough for them to be useful.
>
> On the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.
>
> Throughout this course, we will understand such trade-offs in several scenarios.
> 
> > [!NOTE]+ Topics
> > sequential data (arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists and variants) • dequeues, stacks, queues • graph representations • graph traversals (BFS/DFS) and applications (connected components, bipartiteness, topological sort) • searching and sorting • heaps • BSTs • (2,3)-trees

> [!TLDR]- Target Audience
> This course is aimed at undergraduates in their first or second year, as a first introduction to data structures and algorithms.

> [!Tip]- Pre-requisites
> The course is largely self-contained. Working familiarity with a programming language will be useful for the labs, where solutions are expected to be written out in C.

> The course is hosted on Google classroom (code `amsscja`).
> 
> Please join the classroom to be informed of announcements and to participate in weekly quizzes. These are typically short 15-minute quizzes held in-class, but are open (so you can look things up or discuss the problems). However, giving the quiz from outside the classroom **will be considered a violation of the honor code**.
> 
> Lab exams will be held in the labs and will be evaluated by TAs.
> The midsem and endsem exams will be held as per the institute schedule, and will be pen and paper exams with mostly objective-type questions and a small number of subjective questions. You are allowed to bring a cheat sheet or notebooks or books (within reason), but electronic devices are prohibited.

> - Lab Exams: 10 + 15
> - Midsem and Endsem: 10 + 20
> - In-class worksheets: 20 X 3 (capped at 40)
> - Viva: 5 (every candidate will have one interview on a Saturday afternoon)
