> [!question]- Euler Tour on a Floor Plan
> The following is a floor plan of a house. Is it possible to enter the house in room A, travel through every interior doorway of the house exactly once, and exit out of room E?
> ![Floor Plan](/img/user/Exercises/Short-Answer/figures/0016.png)


> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Interpret the rooms as vertices and connections between rooms as edges, with O denoting the outside. Then we get the following graph:
> 
> $\{AH, HG, BC, BG, GD, GF, CD, EF, EO, OA\}$
> 
> The degrees of the vertices $A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H$ are, respectively, $2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2$. Therefore, a closed Euler circuit exists, and imagining the circuit as one that starts and ends at $O$, we get the desired answer.
> 
> Explicitly, we can take the following route: `OA, AH, HG, GB, BC, CD, DG, GF, FE, EO`.

> [!question]- Make Eulerian
> What is the smallest number of edges you need to add to this graph so that it has an Euler circuit, i.e, a closed Euler tour? Write a number (possibly including 0).
> ![An Example Graph](/img/user/Exercises/Short-Answer/figures/0017.png)


> [!answer]- Spoilers
> We know that a graph has a closed Euler tour if and only if (a) it is connected, and (b) every vertex has even degree. The given graph is already connected. There are only two vertices that violate the degree requirement: D and E, with degrees 3 and 5, respectively. So adding an additional edge between D and E would make the degree of every vertex even.  However, this leads to a multiedge: so if we force the convention that the graph must remain simple after the addition of new edges, the answer is two (we can add edges from both D and E to, say, B).

> [!question]- Bridges and Euler Circuits
> Removing a single edge from a connected graph can make it disconnected. If an edge $e$ is such that $G \setminus e$ has more connected components than $G$ does, then such an edge is called a bridge. Consider the following statement:
> 
> _A graph with a bridge cannot have an Euler circuit (i.e, a closed Euler tour), even if it is connected to begin with._
> 
> True or False?


> [!answer]- Spoilers
> True. Assume $G$ is connected, since a disconnected graph cannot have an Euler circuit anyway. 
> 
> Let $uv$ be a bridge in $G$ and let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be the connected components of $G \setminus e$. Then if $G$ has an Euler circuit $G_1$ and $G_2$ must separately admit Euler circuits as well (why?). However, this implies that all vertices of $G \setminus e$ have even degree, and thus the parity of the degrees of $u$ and $v$ must be odd in $G$, so $G$ cannot have an Euler circuit.
