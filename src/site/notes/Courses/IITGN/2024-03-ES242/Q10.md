> [!note]- The Game of War: Background
> In the [card game war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)), we have a deck of n cards labeled 1 to n. The deck is divided evenly among the players. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their hand—this is a "war"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to the bottom of their hand, with the higher card moved to the bottom first and the lower card moved to the bottom after. 
>
> For example, if n = 4 and Alice has two cards 1,3 (with 3 on top) and Bob has two cards 2,4 (with 2 on top), the the first round of the game progresses as follows:  
>
> _3 vs 2: Alice wins, her deck is now  2, 3, 1 (with 1 on top), and Bob has a deck with only one card with value 4._   

> [!question]- Max Card Advantage
> The player whose deck gets exhausted first loses the game. Can the payer with the card labeled $n$ lose the game?

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Since the card $n$ never leaves the player's hand, the player with this card cannot lose.

> [!question]- Implementation
> You want to write a program that determines, given the hands of both players in War, who wins. What data structure will you use to implement the game?
> 
> - [ ] Stack
> - [ ] Queue
> - [ ] Unclear

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Since cards go from top to bottom, the mechanics are most naturally captured by a queue.
