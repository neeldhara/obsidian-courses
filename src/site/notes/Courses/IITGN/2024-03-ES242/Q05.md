> [!question]- Distinct Degrees
> If $A_G$ is the adjacency matrix of a simple, undirected graph $G$, what is the value of $A^2_G[i,j]$?
> 
> - [ ] the number of common neighbors between vertices i and j
> - [ ] the length of the shortest path between i and j
> - [ ] the total number of neighbors that i and j have together
> - [ ] the maximum of deg(i) and deg(j)

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> The answer follows directly from the definition of $A_G$ and matrix product.
>
> - [X] the number of common neighbors between vertices i and j
> - [ ] the length of the shortest path between i and j
> - [ ] the total number of neighbors that i and j have together
> - [ ] the maximum of deg(i) and deg(j)
