> [!question]- Squared Adjacency Matrix
> If $A_G$ is the adjacency matrix of a simple, undirected graph $G$, what is the value of $A^2_G[i,j]$?
> 
> - [ ] the number of common neighbors between vertices i and j
> - [ ] the length of the shortest path between i and j
> - [ ] the total number of neighbors that i and j have together
> - [ ] the maximum of deg(i) and deg(j)

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> The answer follows directly from the definition of $A_G$ and matrix product.
>
> - [X] the number of common neighbors between vertices i and j
> - [ ] the length of the shortest path between i and j
> - [ ] the total number of neighbors that i and j have together
> - [ ] the maximum of deg(i) and deg(j)

> - [ ] Odd
> - [ ] Even

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Apply the [[Exercises/Short-Answer/0011 Handshake Lemma\|handshake lemma]] to see that the number of people at this party must be even.

> [!question]- An Odd Party
> You are at a party where any two people have an odd number of mutual friends. How many people at the party?
> 
> - [ ] Odd
> - [ ] Even
> - [ ] Impossible to tell


> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Interpret the party as a simple undirected graph in the natural way: vertices are people and edges correspond to friendships. Identify one vertex $v$ and consider the subgraph induced by $N(v)$. Here, everyone other than $v$ has odd degree^[because if $w$ is a neighbor of a $u$ in $N(v)$, then $w$ is a mutual friend of $v$ and $u$; and the number of such mutuals is given to be odd]. So [[Exercises/Short-Answer/0014 An Odd Party\|we know that]] $v$ has even degree. 
> 
> Now consider $H := G \setminus N[v]$. The degree of any vertex $u$ in $H$ must be odd, because $d(u)$ in $G$ was even, and $u$ had an odd number friends in $N[v]$. Thus $|H|$ is even. Since $|N[v]|$ is odd^[note that $N[v] := N(v) \cup \{v\}$, so it has an even number of vertices from $N(v)$ and one additional vertex], we are done.
