> [!question]- Disjoint Stable Matchings from GS
> Is it possible for the outcomes of the men-proposing and women-proposing algorithms to be completely different, i.e, two the two outcomes M1 and M2 have no common pairs at all?

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Yes. Consider an instance where there are two men (`a` and `b`) and two women (`p` and `q`) and assume `a` prefers `p` over `q` and `b` prefers `q` over `p`; while `p` prefers `b` over `a` and `q` prefers `a` over `b`. Then if men propose in the GS algorithm, then we get the matching `((a,p),(b,q))`, while if women propose, we get the matching `((p,b),(q,a))`, and these two matchings have nothing in common.

> [!question]- Identical Stable Matchings from GS
> Is it possible for the outcomes of the men-proposing and women-proposing algorithms to be completely identical?

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> Yes. Consider an instance where there are two men (`a` and `b`) and two women (`p` and `q`) and assume `a` prefers `p` over `q` and `b` prefers `q` over `p`; while `p` prefers `a` over `b` and `q` prefers `b` over `q`. Then `a` and `p` are mutual favorites, as are `b` and `q`. Thus there is a unique stable matching in this instance, which is also the common output of the men-proposing and women-proposing variants of the GS algorithm.

> [!question]- Engagement Status Through GS
> Which of the following statements is true about our algorithm? Assume that men are proposing.
> 
> - [ ] If a man is engaged at some stage of the algorithm, he may become single at a later stage.
> - [ ] If a woman is engaged at some stage of the algorithm, she may become single at a later stage.

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> 
> - [X] If a man is engaged at some stage of the algorithm, he may become single at a later stage.
> - [ ] If a woman is engaged at some stage of the algorithm, she may become single at a later stage.
> 
> When men propose, engagements may be broken in a way that they become single in intermediate phases of the algorithm despite being engaged before. However, women only break off engagements in favor of better partnerships, so once engaged, they remain engaged till the end of the algorithm.
