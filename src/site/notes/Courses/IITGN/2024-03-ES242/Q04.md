> [!question]- Mr and Mrs Sharma Handshake Puzzle
> Mr. and Mrs. Sharma invited three couples to their home.
> 
> Some guests were friends of Mr. Sharma, and some others were friends of Mrs. Sharma. When the guests arrived, people who knew each other beforehand shook hands, those who did not know each other just greeted each other.
> 
> After all this took place, the observant Mr. Sharma said "How interesting. If you disregard me, there are no two people present who shook hands the same number of times". 
> 
> How many times did Mrs. Sharma shake hands?

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> 
> To start, let us represent each person by a node, and let us write the number of handshakes carried out by each person except Mr. Sharma next to the corresponding vertex. This way we must write down nine different nonnegative integers. All these integers must be smaller than seven as nobody shook hands with himself/herself or his/her spouse. So the numbers we wrote down are between 0 and 8 , and since there are nine of them, we must have written down each of the numbers \(0,1,2,3,4,5,6\) exactly once.
> 
> Now let us introduce an edge between two nodes by a line if the corresponding two people shook each other's hands. So we have a graph on eight vertices.
> 
> Let us denote the person with \(i\) handshakes by \(Y_i\). (Mr. Sharma is not assigned any additional notation.) Who can be the spouse of the person \(Y_6\)? We know that \(Y_6\) did not shake the hand of only one other person, so that person must have been his or her spouse. On the other hand, \(Y_6\) certainly did not shake the hand \(Y_0\) as nobody did that. Therefore, \(Y_6\) and \(Y_0\) are married, and \(Y_6\) shook everyone's hand except for \(Y_0\). We can represent this by joining his vertex to all vertices other than \(Y_0\).
> 
> Now try to find the spouse of \(Y_5\), the person with five handshakes. This person did not shake the hands of two people, one of whom was his/her spouse. One of these people is definitely \(Y_0\) as he or she did not shake anyone's hand, and the other one is \(Y_1\) as he or she had only one handshake, and that was with \(Y_6\). As spouses do not shake hands, this implies that the spouse of \(Y_5\) is either \(Y_0\) or \(Y_1\). However, \(Y_0\) is married to \(Y_6\), so \(Y_1\) must be married to \(Y_5\).
> 
> By a similar argument that the reader should be able to complete, \(Y_4\) and \(Y_3\) must be married. That implies that by exclusion, \(Y_4\) is Mrs. Sharma, therefore Mrs. Sharma shook hands four times.

> [!question]- Handshake Lemma
> What can you say about the sum of the degrees of a (simple) graph?
> 
> - [ ] Always even

> - [ ] Unpredictable parity

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> 
> The sum of the degrees of a simple graph is twice the number of edges.
> 
> - [X] Always even

> [!question]- Distinct Degrees
> Can you design a simple (no self-loops, no multi-edges) and undirected graph where no two vertices have the same degree?
> 
> - [ ] Yes
> - [ ] Impossible

> [!answer]- Spoilers
> 
> Apply the pigeon-hole principle: there are \(n\) vertices and \(n-1\) possible degrees (since degree 0 and degree n-1 vertices cannot co-exist). Since there are \(n\) vertices, at least two vertices must have the same degree. Therefore, it is impossible to design a simple and undirected graph where no two vertices have the same degree.
