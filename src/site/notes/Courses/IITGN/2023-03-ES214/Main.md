> [!NOTE]- About the Course
> This is a first course in discrete mathematics and has a broad scope: we introduce elementary concepts in logic, set theory, combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, and probability. The course is designed to be accessible to students from all disciplines, and is a core course for the B.Tech. program at IITGN. We hope that students taking this course discover the beauty of mathematical methods and their applications.

> [!TLDR]- Target Audience
> You will find this course interesting if:
> 
> - you think counting the number of ways in which you can complete your graduation requirements is a fun problem to think about,
> - you enjoy logic puzzles [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKvjIsyYng8) or probability puzzles [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_yU9eJ0NxA), or
> - you like [box-stacking challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Insanity), or
> - you are enrolled in a program for which this course is in the core.

> [!Tip]- Pre-requisites
> This course is self-contained and involves no pre-requisites.
